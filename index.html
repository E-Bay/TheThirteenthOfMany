<h1>What API am I Using?</h1>
    <p>I Plan on using the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/>">Pokemon API (PokeAPI)</a> because it seems the most fun. </p>
<h1>Plans for Project2</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a way to search a pokemon on the PokeAPI</li>
        <li>Have it return Types, Weight, Height, Abilities, Stats and Moves</li>
        <li>Make Hidden Abilities Bold/Different Color</li>
        <li>If the pokemon has something special (Such as different forms) include the forms with an if statement</li>
        <li>Include a image of pokemon (Non-copywritten of course). Preferably one that says "Gotta Catch 'Em All"</li>
        <li>Possibly provide the sprite images used. Not too sure about this one however</li>
        <li>Provide possible name of image used/description of the sprite (front female/front male/back female/back male/etc.)</li>
        <li>Possibly create a small list of Pokemon to search up if you don't know too many pokemon/a list of interesting pokemon</li>
    </ol>
<h1>Questions About the Project</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I am still a little confused as to how the "If" statements work, I have an idea, but it is confusing.</li>
        <li>What would be the best way to incorporate my first project idea?</li>
        <li>Do we use the "Promise" statement everytime with these things?</li>
        <li>How do the greater than, equal to, and less than, attributes work? When are they used? Why do you use "==" instead of just "="?</li>
        <li>In the Planettable app, I saw a function being used with multiple parameters, how do thsoe different perameters work in that function?</li>
        <li>How would I go about including the searcher?</li>
        <li>It appears that PokeAPI is missing some pokemon. What do I do about this? Or should I just ignore this?</li>
        <li>Do I need to include the filter similar to how you did it? As I don't think this will be useful for mine.</li>
        <li>If I decide to use the sprites, how would I go about incorporating them? Would they be similar to creating an image and in the .attr part of d3 include the link?</li>
    </ul>
